Hi, Iâ€™m Missy Bridgwater, a second year Computer Science student at UCLA. I am dedicated to 
using programming to make an impact on the world, which I have started through my research
position at UCLA's Medical Imaging and Informatics lab. For this position, I will be presenting
to primary care physicans about how machine learning can be implemented in clinics to reduce 
racial health disparities, particularly within Chronic Kidney Disease. In my classes, I am 
currently learning about operating systems and computer graphics and looking to collaborate on 
really anything! I have experience in front-end web development, C++, python, low-level 
programming, and more! Please reach out to me through LinkedIn by searching Missy Bridgwater.
