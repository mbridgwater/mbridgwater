Hi, Iâ€™m Missy Bridgwater, a third year Computer Science student at UCLA. I am dedicated to 
using programming to make an impact on the world, which I started through my research
position at UCLA's Medical Imaging and Informatics lab. For this position, I presented
to primary care physicans about how machine learning can be implemented in clinics to reduce 
racial health disparities, particularly within Chronic Kidney Disease. I have experience in 
front-end web development, databases, C++, python, low-level programming, and more! Please 
reach out to me through LinkedIn at https://github.com/mbridgwater.
